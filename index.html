				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Hello everyone, my name is Tony Le (s3941202@student.rmit.edu.au ) and I hope that by the end of the site you will get to know me better :-). I was born and raised in Australia my whole life, however, my ethnicity is Vietnamese. I would like to say I am very in touch with my cultural heritage as I was made to attend a Vietnamese Language School from an early age.
        Despite spending a portion of my life learning Vietnamese, my writing and reading skills for it are still average at best. Fast forward 11 years and I somehow managed to graduate from the Sunday school alongside highschool.
        I typically spend my free time playing video games, watching k-dramas on netflix or reading manga. The games I normally play and have an unhealthy addiction to are League of Legends, Dota 2 and CSGO. </p>

				<h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
        <p>I’m interested in creating applications that can be of convenience to people’s everyday lives. My interest in IT probably started from watching hours of technology videos on youtube and seeing what programming can actually do once applied in real life.
          I chose to come to RMIT as I have heard that the university is great when it comes to IT and its location in the city is an added bonus.
          During my studies, I expect to develop a better understanding of the different aspects of information technology and gain more experience in programming to be able to one day work on a project of my own. The project in mind might be something like a mobile app or a video game.

				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
				<p>I have always had an interest in the behind the scenes of video games so to be able to take part in the development of a game has always been a dream of mine. The thing that appeals to me the most is that I will be able to collaborate with different teams and have a bit of control over what I want to create. </p>
        <p>Proficient knowledge and skill of the programming language C++ alongside the ability to work independently on the job without too much supervision is greatly needed for this job. There is also the requirement of having prior game development experience in which one must have completed a major games project. </p>
				<p>As of currently, I have not gotten the skills, qualification or experience that can contribute to me applying for the position. As a starting point, I can begin learning C++ through an online course and gradually make some progress towards a small simple game. I guess building a strong foundation for programming in general is a necessity as it will help with completing the assigned tasks more efficiently and also to decrease frustration. The job seems to require a great amount of experience with game designing which I can obtain by analysing various games and taking notes.</p>

			<h3>MBTI Test </h3>
      <img src="images/myers_briggs.png"
      width=200"
      height=400"/>
      <p>My result came out to be ISFP-T. These results show that I am constantly in search of answers and open to any other perspectives that are different from mine. It also mentions that I live life with the go-with-the-flow mentality which is spot on as I don’t tend to plan ahead but I hope I can fix that. </p>
      <p>Although I am open-minded and consider the opinions of others I am introverted so socialising especially in a group will be an obstacle to overcome. My go-with-the-flow mentality as mentioned earlier is kind of like an advantage and disadvantage when it comes to group work since I’m flexible when things go wrong but I also don’t prepare a lot until the deadline of an assignment. </p>
      <p>The only concern when forming a team as an adventurer is being the team leader as I am not the best at planning ahead and deciding dates to have meetings. </p>
      <h3>Online Learning Style Test</h3>
      <img src="images/big_5.png"
      width=500"
      height=400"/>
      <p>From the online learning style test results, it appears that I am a visual learner rather than an auditory or tactile learner. These results mean that I learn best by reading or seeing pictures. It also says that I am easily distracted by sound so being in a noisy environment will hinder my learning.</p>
      <p>My visual learning style will definitely become an issue in a team if most of the assignment information is explained auditory instead of visually. I may also need to jot down notes or draw diagrams to understand certain concepts or ideas explained by my teammate.</p>
      <p>When forming a team, I should try to gather those that are also visual learners so we can get to learn and understand the assignment and the work faster using visual learning methods.</p>
      <h3>Big Five Personality Test</h3>
      <img src="images/learning_styles.png"
      width=600"
      height=250"/>
      <p>Openness, agreeableness and neuroticism are my dominant traits. My high score of openness reflects my tendency to think in creative and abstract ways and also to take in new ideas easily. Although my way of thinking is adventurous, I can be much more discouraged when things do not go right for me as my neuroticism is quite high. </p>
      <p>My low score in extraversion is the lowest out of the big five assessments which means that I am not a social person and that I rarely seek attention from others. This can be an obstacle in group assignments as I tend to keep to myself rather than discuss any problems with my team members. </p>
      <p>I think finding a wide variety of people when forming a team will be especially important to balance out my introversion. For example if a whole team is filled with introverts, not much discussions will be held and the work would not progress as smoothly.</p>

  				<h2>Project Idea</h2>
  			</header>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest problems that people around the globe (including me) tend to be facing daily seems to be procrastination. I want to design and develop a mobile phone app that gradually removes their habit of leaving things until the last minute by making them create strict schedules or timetables that will push them to complete tasks without delay.</p>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>This project will be of convenience to everyone who wishes to have a clearer and stricter schedule rather than having their productivity hindered as a result of leaving the to-do until the very last minute. With the current increase in digital devices and the internet, the general procrastination rate is also increasing as people tend to be glued to social media and youtube which consumes most of their time.</p>
        <p>Students are one of the major procrastinators as studies show that approximately 80%-95% of university students frequently procrastinate to some extent. As a result, there may be a huge market for student-oriented scheduling mobile applications.</p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The mobile app’s main purpose is to become a turning point for procrastinators, especially students with their homework. Although this app will be mainly marketed towards students, this is also a great tool for people of all ages who want to be more productive during their day. </p>
        <p>The application in mind will run in the background and track the time you spend on your mobile phone and report back to you at the end of the day. The first function you will notice when opening the app is the timetable creator which you will need to fill out for each week and follow. If the time you spend on certain apps like social media or mobile games exceeds a certain threshold every week then the app will automatically set you a goal to reduce screen time which you can work towards. The app will also monitor whether you complete the task you set out to do or not and provide some kind of reward if you do. </p>
        <p>The reward to keep the users motivated could be stuff ranging from coupons/vouchers or progress with a certain game/activity that would be implemented to the app. For example, when you hit a certain goal or complete a number of set tasks, your pets in the app will grow or something like that.</p>
        <h3>Skills Required</h3>
        <p>To create the software, I will need to learn how to program using kotlin or javascript as the language since they are the most popular language used for mobile applications. I would also need to become familiar with SQL to manage the databases to allow the app users to store their data. Learning the programming languages and becoming familiar with SQL will take quite a while and would be difficult as I have no prior experience with these languages.</p>
        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>If this project is successful then countless people will have the opportunity to readjust their habits of procrastination and begin to become much more productive. Gradually fixing their habits will teach them discipline which will make a positive impact on their time management and help them in the long term to avoid procrastination.</p>
